Overriding In Java is SIMILAR to Overloading in C++

in C++ the 'virtual' keyword is used

Subclass has a method/function with the same name and (possibly parameters) as in the super/base/parent class
-usually a constructor of sorts

Also remember member/method visibility
-private in base cannot be accessed by subclass
