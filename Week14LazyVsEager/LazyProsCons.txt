Lazy evaluation, also known as call-by-need, is an evaluation 
strategy that delays the evaluation of an expression until its 
value is actually needed. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages:

Pros of Lazy Evaluation:

Efficiency in Handling Infinite Data Structures:
Lazy evaluation is particularly useful when dealing with potentially infinite 
data structures. It allows you to represent and work with infinite sequences 
without the need to compute all elements in advance.

Efficient Use of Resources:

Lazy evaluation can save resources by only evaluating what is necessary.
This is beneficial when dealing with large data sets or computations where 
not all elements or results are needed.

Improved Performance in Some Cases:
Lazy evaluation can lead to performance improvements in situations 
where not all computations are required. By delaying the evaluation 
until the result is needed, unnecessary work can be avoided.

Support for Composition of Functions:
Lazy evaluation facilitates the composition of functions, as computations 
are deferred until necessary. This supports the creation of modular and reusable code.

Memoization Opportunities:
Lazy evaluation provides opportunities for memoization, where the results of expensive
function calls are cached and reused when the same computation is needed again. This can 
improve performance in certain scenarios.

Simplifies Control Flow:
Lazy evaluation can simplify control flow, making it easier to express complex 
logic in a more concise and readable manner.

Cons of Lazy Evaluation:

Potential Space Leaks:
Lazy evaluation can lead to space leaks, where unnecessary values are retained in memory. 
If not managed properly, this can result in higher memory consumption than expected.

Difficulty in Reasoning about Performance:
Lazy evaluation can make it challenging to reason about the performance of a program 
since the order of evaluation is not always obvious. This can make it harder to predict 
the resource usage of a program.

Debugging Complexity:
Debugging lazy evaluation-based code can be more challenging due to the non-obvious order 
of evaluation. It may be harder to trace back and understand the sequence of computations.

Potential Overhead:
Introducing lazy evaluation can sometimes introduce overhead, 
especially if there's a need to manage thunks (unevaluated expressions) and their dependencies.

Difficulty in Predicting Execution Time:
Predicting the execution time of a lazy evaluation-based program can be difficult, 
as the time at which computations occur depends on when the results are actually needed.
Compatibility Issues:

Lazy evaluation may not be suitable for all programming paradigms or algorithms, and 
integrating lazy evaluation into existing codebases may require significant changes.
In summary, lazy evaluation offers benefits in terms of efficiency and composability, 
particularly in scenarios involving infinite data structures or complex functional composition.
However, it comes with challenges related to space leaks, debugging, and predicting performance,
and it may not be the best fit for all situations.
