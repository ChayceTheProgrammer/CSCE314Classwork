Eager evaluation, also known as strict evaluation, 
is a strategy in which expressions are evaluated as 
soon as they are bound to variables. Here are some 
pros and cons of eager evaluation:

Pros:
Predictable Behavior: Eager evaluation provides a predictable order of execution. 
The order in which expressions are evaluated is explicit and follows the sequence 
of statements in the code.

Early Error Detection: Eager evaluation can help detect errors early 
in the program execution. If there are issues with expressions or variable values, 
they are typically identified at the point of evaluation.

Memory Usage: Eager evaluation can be memory-efficient in some cases. 
Once an expression is evaluated, the intermediate results can be discarded, 
potentially reducing memory usage compared to strategies that retain all intermediate results.

Performance Optimization: In some scenarios, eager evaluation allows for better 
optimization by the compiler or runtime environment. It can enable the application of 
various optimization techniques, such as loop unrolling or inlining.

Intuitive Debugging: Debugging is often more straightforward with eager evaluation because 
the program state is updated immediately after each statement is executed, making it easier to 
track and understand the flow of execution.

Cons:

Inefficiency with Unused Values: Eager evaluation may lead to inefficiencies when evaluating
expressions that result in values that are not ultimately used in the program. This can result
in unnecessary computation.

Limited Support for Infinite Data Structures: Eager evaluation may struggle with infinite 
data structures or lazy computations, as it attempts to evaluate all elements or operations 
immediately, leading to potential issues with infinite loops or memory exhaustion.

Reduced Laziness: Eager evaluation is inherently less lazy compared to lazy evaluation. 
Laziness can be beneficial in situations where not all computations are needed or where the cost 
of computation is high.

Potential for Unnecessary Work: In some cases, eager evaluation might perform unnecessary 
work by evaluating expressions that do not contribute to the final result. This can be a drawback 
in scenarios where computation is expensive.

Harder to Express Control Flow: Eager evaluation may make it more challenging to express certain 
control flow patterns or advanced programming constructs. Lazy evaluation can provide more flexibility
 in composing computations.

In summary, while eager evaluation offers predictability, early error detection, 
and certain performance advantages, it may also introduce inefficiencies, especially 
when dealing with unused values or infinite data structures. The choice between eager and lazy 
evaluation depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application or programming
language.
